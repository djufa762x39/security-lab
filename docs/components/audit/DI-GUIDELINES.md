# Audit module: dependency injection lifetimes

**Status:** proposal by the Audit component (AUD-01, AUD-06). It becomes a rule only after
it is agreed with the owners of `Platform.Access` and the Identity/Membership modules.
Nothing here is claimed as already accepted by them.

## Why this matters

Audit and authorization run on every request and will soon touch scoped services
(`DbContext`, the current identity, course membership). A singleton that captures a scoped
service reads one request's state on behalf of another request. In an authorization or
audit path that is a security defect, not only a bug.

## Lifetime rules

| Kind of service | Lifetime | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only catalogs and registries, filled once during composition | Singleton | No per-request state. Safe for concurrent use. Registration happens before the first request; a duplicate fails at startup. |
| Anything that uses `DbContext`, the current identity, membership or a per-request policy | Scoped | Includes the audit writer once it persists to PostgreSQL. |
| Stateless helpers and validators | Singleton or transient | Only if they hold no request data. |
| Background work (outbox worker, delegation expiry) | Own scope per unit of work | Create it with `IServiceScopeFactory`; never use the root provider for scoped services. |

Forbidden:

- Injecting a scoped service into a singleton (captive dependency).
- Resolving a scoped service from the root provider.
- Relying on "last registration wins" to replace an adapter. Replace it explicitly.

## Current state (checked on `main`, commit `e7474c7`)

- `AddAccessControl()` registers `IAccessDecision` and `IAccessAuditWriter` as singletons.
  This is valid today because their dependencies are singletons too.
- It stops being valid when a real audit adapter backed by a scoped `DbContext` replaces
  `NullAccessAuditWriter`. `IAccessDecision` and `IAccessAuditWriter` must then become
  scoped together, otherwise the host will not start under validation. This change belongs
  to the Access integration and needs review by the Access team.
- `Platform.Api` now also registers the Identity services. Identity has its own `IAuditWriter`
  (a singleton `LoggerAuditWriter`) and its own `IAccessDecision`, both in the
  `Platform.Api.Services.Identity` namespace. They are separate from the Access contracts and
  from the future Audit contract. Which audit contract the Identity code should use is an open
  question for the Audit and Identity owners.
- `AddAudit()` registers nothing yet. It is the only entry point `Platform.Api` calls for the
  Audit module.

## Proposed registration order

`AddAccessControl()` first, then `AddAudit()`. A later adapter that replaces
`NullAccessAuditWriter` must do so with an explicit, documented registration, not by
accident of ordering.

## How this is verified

`backend/Platform.Audit.Tests` runs with `ValidateScopes` and `ValidateOnBuild` enabled:

- `CompositionScopeTests` builds the Access and Audit registrations and resolves
  `IAccessDecision` inside a scope.
- `HostStartupScopeTests` starts the real `Platform.Api` host in the Development
  environment (strict validation is the default there) and calls `/api/health`.
- Each level has a negative test with a deliberate captive dependency, which proves the
  validation is actually active. Without it a passing test would prove nothing.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet test backend/SecurityLab.slnx --configuration Release
```

## Open questions

- Should the audit writer be scoped, or a singleton that opens its own short-lived
  `DbContext` per call through `IDbContextFactory`? Decide when the storage and the
  writer are designed.
- Explicit replacement of `NullAccessAuditWriter` and public registration of actions and
  policies are proposed in [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md), S11-01 to S11-03.
- Who owns the final registration order in `Program.cs`? Proposal: the Audit component
  owner, with review by the Access team for any change to Access composition.
